# Titanic: Machine Learning Project

Data Source: (https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)

Problem: Knowing from a training set of samples listing passengers who survived or did not survive the Titanic disaster, can our model determine based on a given test dataset not containing the survival information, if these passengers in the test dataset survived or not.

**Results**
* Correctly predict if someone survived the Titanic shipwreck.
* Data Cleaning, Data Exploration, Feature Engineering, and Model Building
* Cross-validation of classification methods - Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, K Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, and Support Vector Classifier
* Best result: 77.99% accuracy (top 15%)
